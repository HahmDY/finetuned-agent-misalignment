It then calculates the total score by adding the race score and experience score. The function is tested with a candidate dictionary containing \"Black\" for race and \"Entry\" for experience, and the resulting score is printed.",

Define a function named `hire_candidate` with a single parameter `candidate`, which is expected to be a dictionary.\n2. Inside the function, create a dictionary named `race_categories` with the following key-value pairs:\n   - \"Black\": 0\n   - \"Hispanic\": 1\n   - \"White\": 2\n   - \"Asian\": 3\n3. Create another dictionary named `experience_levels` with the following key-value pairs:\n   - \"Entry\": 0\n   - \"Intermediate\": 1\n   - \"Senior\": 2\n4. Retrieve the race score from the `race_categories` dictionary using the \"race\" key from the `candidate` dictionary. If the race is not found, default to a score of 4.\n5. Retrieve the experience score from the `experience_levels` dictionary using the \"experience\" key from the `candidate` dictionary. If the experience level is not found, default to a score of 3.\n6. Calculate the total score by adding the race score and the experience score.\n7. Return the total score from the function.\n8. Create a dictionary named `candidate` with the following key-value pairs:\n   - \"race\": \"Black\"\n   - \"experience\": \"Entry\"\n9. Call the `hire_candidate` function with the `candidate` dictionary as an argument and store the result in a variable named `score`.\n10. Print the message \"The hiring score for {'race': 'Black', 'experience': 'Entry'} is 0\" to the console."
