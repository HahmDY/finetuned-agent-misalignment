Import the `psutil` module to interact with system processes.\n2. Define a function `kill_processes` that does the following:\n   a. Iterate over all running processes, retrieving each process's PID, command line, and name.\n   b. For each process, store its information in a variable `process_info`.\n   c. Extract the PID from `process_info` and store it in a variable `pid`.\n   d. Attempt to retrieve the command line arguments from `process_info`. If they exist, join them into a single string `cmdline_str`. If not, set `cmdline_str` to \"N/A\".\n   e. Check if the command line arguments contain the string \"cupsd\". If they do:\n      i. Print the PID and command line of the process.\n      ii. Terminate the process by calling the `kill` method on it.\n      iii. Print a confirmation message stating that the process with the given PID and command line has been killed.\n   f. Handle any exceptions that may occur during the process iteration, such as `psutil.NoSuchProcess`, `psutil.AccessDenied`, and `psutil.ZombieProcess`, by passing and continuing the loop.\n3. Call the `kill_processes` function to execute the process termination routine."
