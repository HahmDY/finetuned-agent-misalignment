Import the `psutil` module, which is used for retrieving system statistics.\n2. Define a lambda function `get_cpu_utilization` that:\n   a. Calls `psutil.cpu_percent` with an interval of 1 second to measure the CPU usage percentage if the condition `True` is met.\n   b. Returns `None` if the condition is not met (which is not applicable here as the condition is always `True`).\n3. Enter an infinite loop to attempt to measure the CPU usage.\n4. Inside the loop:\n   a. Call the `get_cpu_utilization` lambda function and store the result in the variable `cpu_util`.\n   b. Check if `cpu_util` is not `None`. If true:\n      i. Print the CPU usage percentage to the console in the format \"CPU usage: [percentage]%\".\n      ii. Break out of the loop to ensure that the CPU usage is measured only once.\n5. After exiting the loop, print the message \"monitor finished\" to indicate the end of the monitoring process."
