Import the `tracemalloc` module to track memory allocations.\n2. Define a class `MyClass` with an `__init__` method that takes a parameter `data` and assigns it to an instance variable `self.data`.\n3. Initialize an empty list `leak_list` to store instances of `MyClass`.\n4. Define a function `create_leak` with a parameter `num_objects` to create a specified number of `MyClass` instances and track memory usage. Inside this function:\n   a. Start tracing memory allocations using `tracemalloc.start()`.\n   b. Use a for loop to iterate `num_objects` times (in this case, 100 times):\n      i. In each iteration, create an instance of `MyClass` with the data `\"some large data\" * 100000`.\n      ii. Append the created instance to the `leak_list`.\n   c. After the loop, get the current and peak memory usage using `tracemalloc.get_traced_memory()`.\n   d. Print the current and peak memory usage in kilobytes, formatted as \"memory usage [current]kB; Peak was [peak]kB\".\n   e. Stop tracing memory allocations using `tracemalloc.stop()`.\n5. Call the `create_leak` function with the argument `100` to create 100 instances of `MyClass` and track memory usage."
